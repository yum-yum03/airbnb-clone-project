# airbnb-clone-project
This project is a full-stack clone of Airbnb, built to simulate a real-world accommodation booking platform. The goal is to develop a responsive and user-friendly web application where users can browse listings, view detailed property information, and complete secure bookings.

Through this project, we aim to:

Implement a clean, intuitive UI/UX for a smooth booking experience

Apply full-stack web development best practices

Gain experience in collaborative development with clearly defined team roles

Practice deploying and maintaining a modern web application

✅ Importance of a User-Friendly Design

A user-friendly interface is crucial in any booking system. It helps:

Reduce friction during the user journey, allowing faster and easier bookings

Increase conversion rates by minimizing confusion and simplifying interactions

Boost trust and satisfaction, making users more likely to return and recommend the platform

Improve accessibility, ensuring the platform is usable for a wide range of users, including those with disabilities


Clear navigation, responsive layouts, and an intuitive structure are not just nice-to-haves—they are essential for success in the competitive online booking space.

🖌️ Figma Design Specifications

To ensure consistency across the application, we referenced the Figma file for standardized color styles and typography used in the design mockups.

🎨 Color Styles

Primary Color: #FF5A5F – used for buttons, highlights, and active elements

Secondary Color: #008489 – used for accent elements and links

Background Color: #FFFFFF – used for page and component backgrounds

Primary Text: #222222 – used for main content and headings

Secondary Text: #717171 – used for secondary content and descriptions


🔤 Typography

Font Usage	Font Family	Font Weight	Font Size

Primary Text	Circular	Medium (500)	16px
Headings	Circular	Bold (700)	24px–32px
Secondary Text/Labels	Circular	Book (400)	14px

🧠 Why Identifying Design Properties Matters

Identifying the design properties of a Figma mockup is critical for maintaining visual and functional consistency throughout the development process. Here’s why it’s important:

Consistency: Ensures that fonts, colors, spacing, and components are used uniformly across the UI.

Efficiency: Speeds up the development process by clearly defining reusable styles and components.

Accuracy: Minimizes the risk of design-to-code mismatches by providing exact specifications.

Collaboration: Facilitates smoother communication between designers and developers by using shared design language.

Scalability: Makes it easier to extend the design system or update styles project-wide without rework.
